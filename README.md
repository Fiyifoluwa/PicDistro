## PicDistro

This project is an image gallery that takes input of image files (jpeg & png) and passes that image into the image grid.

All transitions and smooth motions are powered by Framer Motion.
Firebase is the database provider where we employ firestore for storage and realtime updates in this application.
Also powered by the powerful React Hooks.
